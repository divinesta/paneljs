# What this is

PanelJS is an operations panel for apps that already use **Express** and **Prisma**.

You register the models you want to operate on. At mount, the library reads your `schema.prisma`, builds metadata, and serves:

- a React admin UI at `/admin`
- a guarded JSON API at `/admin/api/*`

You do not describe your tables twice. The Prisma schema is the source of truth. `admin.register("User")` with no extra config still produces a list, search, filters, and a create/edit form.

## The whole public API

```ts
const admin = createAdmin({ prisma, auth: { getCurrentUser } });

admin
  .register("User")
  .register("Post", { listDisplay: ["title", "author", "published"] });

await admin.mount(app);
```

Three calls. Everything else is optional configuration on those calls.

## What you bring

| You own                                                | The library owns                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Express app                                            | Admin routes under `basePath`                 |
| Generated Prisma Client                                | Introspection of `schema.prisma`              |
| Built-in admin credentials, or external authentication | Creating an `AdminUser` request context       |
| Tenancy rules, via `scope()`                           | Applying that scope on every record operation |
| Optional audit destination                             | Emitting safe, append-only events             |

Built-in mode provides an admin-only login screen, `ExpressAdminUser` table, and
session store. External mode still lets you map an existing identity onto an
`AdminUser`. See [Authentication](/guide/auth).

## What this is not

- Not a replacement for your public API
- Not a CMS with nested document editing
- Not AdminJS with a Prisma adapter bolted on — DMMF is the contract
- Not a multi-ORM tool (see [Prisma versions](/limits/prisma))

Current writes are **scalar** plus a single `belongsTo` foreign key. Nested creates, many-to-many editors, inlines, and uploads are [not included](/limits/not-included).

## The people in these docs

The [basic example](/example/basic) seeds two companies and three operators. The Trust and Extend guides reuse them so the rules stay concrete.

| Person         | Role          | Tenant    | What they see                      |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Ada Lovelace   | `ADMIN`       | Northwind | Northwind users and posts          |
| Grace Hopper   | `ADMIN`       | Contoso   | Contoso users and posts            |
| Linus Torvalds | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Northwind | Both, because `scope` returns `{}` |

Same role does not mean same rows. That distinction — **permissions vs scope** — is the point of this library.

## Next

1. [Getting started](/guide/getting-started) — install `@paneljs/paneljs` and mount
2. [Wire it into your app](/guide/in-your-app) — `listDisplay`, `searchFields`, `listFilter`, `scope`
